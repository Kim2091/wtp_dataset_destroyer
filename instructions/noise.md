`*` = optional parameters


- `type` - The list of blur algorithms to use
- `alpha`* - Controls how transparent the noise is when overlaid
- `probability`* - The chance of applying (e.g. 0.5 = 50% chance of being applied)
- `y_noise`* - The chance that the noise will be applied only on the tone component in color images. (Generates color noise)
- `uv_noise`* - The chance **that noise will only affect color components, ignoring tone in color images** (Generates monochrome noise)
- `bias` - The noise offset. Uses `[int,int]` with min -1, max 1

Additional settings for this noise list ("perlinsuflet", "perlin", "opensimplex", "simplex", "supersimplex")
- `normalize`* - Normalizes noise within the range of `-1 - 1` (bool)
  - ðŸ‘‹ opensimplex
- `octaves`* - Noise re-call amount. Accepts `[low, high, step]`
- `frequency`* - Division of image point size. Accepts `[low, high, step]`
  - Image point size refers to the size of the smallest discernible element (pixel) in an image
- `lacunarity`* - Controls how much the frequency decreases when the frequency is multiplied by the lacunarity. Accepts `[low, high, step]`.

Additional settings for this noise list ("salt","pepper","salt_and_pepper")
- `probability_salt_or_pepper`* - The percentage of salt and pepper noise applied
