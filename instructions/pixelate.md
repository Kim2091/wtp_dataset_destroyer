```json
    {
      "type": "pixelate",
      "size": [0, 10],
      "probability": 0.9
    }
```
`*` = optional parameters

- `size` - the degree of pixelation accepts an array `[low, high]`. It is important to note that it works not with int sizes, but with float.
- `probability`* - The chance of applying (e.g. 0.5 = 50% chance of being applied)
